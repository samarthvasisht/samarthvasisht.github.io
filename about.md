Setting this website up as a place to share personal projects and opinions. Excuse the name, it's hard picking a unique domain. That being said, I do think it does a good job summing up the way I think about my views. 

My name is Samarth Vasisht, I work as a quantitative user experience researcher at Google. My work focuses on making the experience of buying ads easier for advertisers. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to build an experience that is simple and easy to use for advertisers, regardless of their expertise. I enjoy work that focuses on building data infrastructure that enables fast, consistent analysis that has lasting impact. 

I spent my early childhood in San Antonio (Go Spurs), but associate most with North Carolina, where I went to middle/high school and college. I graduated from UNC with majors in Biology and Economics, and moved to SF after graduating and have lived there since. I'm traveling at the moment, but plan on going back to the bay at some point. 

I try to spend my free time outside as much as possible. I enjoy backpacking, photography, skiing and just about anything else outdoors. I spend a lot of my time reading about economics, finance, the weather, and data science related topics.
